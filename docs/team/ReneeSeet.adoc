=== Enhancement Added: Mass Emailing

The mass emailing function aims to help businesses reach out to their customers efficiently.

==== Justification

A mass emailing function would allow to businesses to send out monthly newsletters, greetings or reminders to all their customers. 
Furthermore, it would be more efficient if businesses can send to specific different group of customers defined by their tags.
By having this function, users need to go through the hassle switch to other platforms just to email their customers.

==== Future Improvements

It is possible to change the command word for mass emailing to `email` instead of `mass` as it is more intuitive.

=== Enhancement Added: Add Joined Date



==== Justification
Businesses would want to keep track of when their customers joined date. Joined date can be useful for tracking customers' fees due date or
how long this customer has been supporting the business.

==== External behavior

When a new customer is added to CYNC, a joined date is automatically stored 

==== Implementation


==== Future Improvements
* Allow users to edit the joined date for customers.
* With the joined date of each customer, CYNC can calculate when customers' fees are due and send out automated reminders to customers.
* CYNC can also send out automated anniversary emails to customers. 

=== Enhancement Added: Login Page

I decided not to use the Login Page after I implemented it. As I realised that it led to much coupling which is undesirable.
I edited the test cases to go through the Login Page before every test. This cause the testcases to be dependent on the function.

==== Justification

Customers' information are valuable and businesses would want to protect and store them safely. 
A login page on CYNC would deter unauthorised users to gain access to customers' data.
Furthermore, since both the Mass Emailing and the Calendar functions requires Google authentication, it can be done when logging into CYNC.

==== External behavior

Upon launching the application, you will be greeted with a login page as shown below.

You will be required to sign in with your Google email and password.

==== Implementation

Upon launching the application, the UI manager will load the login Panel only.
When user click the `Login` button or pressed `enter`, if the `email:` and `password:` textboxes are correct, a `LoginRequestEvent`
will be posted to the `EventsCenter`. This will unlock the rest of the components of `MainWindow` as well as displaying customers' informations.
If the textboxes are empty, CYNC will prompt the user to fill them.

==== Alternative Implementation 

In order for the login function to be less coupled with the other functions, I should have implemented the login page on a different scene.
This will allow testing to be less coupled as we can test the login page on its own. Furthermore, it is not safe to store default password and email thus
first time users should be prompted to login to their google account first. Then, CYNC will update with the vaild email and password.
We can do so by integrating with Google Authetification API.


=== Enhancement Proposed: View email inbox
This is a possible feature for CYNC in the future.
A command `inbox` will list out all emails that user have and user can view their emails and reply to them on CYNC.
This will require them to
