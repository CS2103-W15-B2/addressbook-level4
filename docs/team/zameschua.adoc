== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
CYNC is an open-source software that helps small businesses to
track and nurture relationships with customers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 8 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/zameschua/addressbook-level4/blob/master/collated/main/zameschua.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/tree/master/collated/test[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Command Prediction

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=commandprediction]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Because the main mode of interaction with CYNC is via a Command Line Interface,
as a user, I often find it difficult to recall what are the exact commands that I need to type.

This is where the Command Prediction helps aid the user such that they do not have to remember
the entire command.

The Command Prediction was intentionally made simple for another developer to add another
set of predictions (extending beyond the default commands).
